It's 9 o'clock on a November morning but I'm surprised to see Doon's winter still being bearable this late in the year. We had breakfast and tea before heading out for our first stop at Dhanaulti. At Ballupur Chowk we took the route that goes via Garhi Cantonment which eventually merges with the Mussoorie Road at Malsi. This route cicumvents Doon's Clock Tower and Rajpur Road.

We followed the Mussoorie Road till JP Bend, a sharp bend which appears some distance before the multi-level car park at Kincraig. I've always been keen to find out the origins of Kincraig, a place that is hard to pinpoint on Google Maps and which bears a name that is relatively unknown to people except the locals. As I understood, from some text, the name - no marks for guessing it was given by the British - had been kept after a place in Scotland. Up until 1950, Kincraig would be the last point where vehicles would go to, beyond which people would have to walk on foot.

At JP Bend we took the road that diverged towards Landour which eventually takes us to Dhanaulti.

As a kid I had been to Eco Park, a popular attraction in Dhanaulti, but when we reached there it seemed I had no memory of it. I remembered an Apple Orchard present there somewhere. Dad told it was a private estate, although open for visits, situated at the upper heights of the mountain that the Park was on. If memory served him right a path to it begins from inside the Park and another, less trodden one, lay outside and away from it.

Beyond the Eco Park there are quite a few restaurants serving refreshments. We pit-stopped at one before leaving for Chamba, the entrypoint to Tehri.

Surkhanda Devi Temple lied on the way. The stairs to the temple begin around an entrance arch right next to the tarmac, and lead to the top the mountain where the temple resides. It is a nice little hike to the top and had been on my bucket list for a while. Since we were short on time checking it was not to be that day. Although Mummyfeld it would be appropriate that at the very least we pay our respects at the entrance arch. Quickly coming out of our car, we went straight for the bell tied to the entrance arch, rung it, brought our palms together in a _Namaste_, bowed our heads, and chanted Jai Surkhanda Devi.

Enroute to Tehri we passed through Kanatal and Chamba. Chamba in particular seemed like a lively bustling town.

We finally reached Tehri _Jheel_ (lake) at 2 in the afternoon. We seemed to have arrived at an opportune moment as there was an Acro Festival being held there. It featured boat riding, parasailing, jet skying, and even paragliding from the top of the mountains. I was a little disappointed to learn that paragliding was not open for tourists but was strictly for exper pilots who apparently had been invited from different countries by the organizers to take part in the Acro Paragliding competition.

Overall it was nice to hear government promoting tourism especially to the outside world.

What we call the Tehri lake is a reservoir formed at the _Sangam_ (confluence) of two rivers: Bhagirathi river, flowing in from the north-west, and a much smaller Bhilangana, flowing in from the east. At the confluence lies the Tehri Dam which is powered by the reservoir. The river that comes out on the other end of the Dam is still Bhagirati which eventually meets the Alaknanda river at Devprayag to form the mighty Ganga.

It was 4 o'clock in the evening and we thought we better leave early to avoid driving at night - as much was possible by then.

For our way back, which would still go via Chamba, we took the Rishikesh-Chamba-Tehri Road that goes via Narendra Nagar and opens up at Rishikesh.

A few kilometers behind Narendra Nagar lies a town named Agrakhal. Khal is a Garhwali word that refers to a hill with a flat top (plateau). A lot of the shps there were selling local produce, most prominent of which was _Adrak_ (ginger). Small restaurants serving tean and food hand their kitchens outward toward the road. Something caught my eye: almost all of these had a pan of what is called _Bhutwa_ -  a stew of pieces of goat meat that had been cut from various organs for the goat. We ordered one plate, and while eating I was only able to make out the pieces that tasted like liver. Rest of the bits and pieces tasted unsual to my tongue which wasn't privy to rest of the goat organs. Nevertheless I finished the plate, thanked the owner Mr. Rawat, and we went on our way.

Some produce bought from Agrakhal:
(brown) Gaunth Dal - makes for great Parathas
(black) Bhatt Dal - makes for great Chutney
(multicolored) Sabut Toor Dal
(red) Unrefined Rice - still contains bran which is used in making oil

Narendra Nagar has been on my bucket list of places to visit on account of the Palace of Garhwal Maharajas that is present in the town. Narendra Shar, after whom the town is named, reigned over the Tehri Garhwal Kingdom from 1913 to 1946. In 1919, he moved the capital of Garhwal Kingdom from Tehri to the place which would become Narendra Nagar. I was slightly disappointed to hear that a resort named Ananda had taken the Palace's place. To me, historical structures such as this Palace must be preserved so future generations can cling on to their past. I hope the resort has help the original Palace structures and also put on display its history for the visitors to appreciate. I shall visit it some day.

At Narendra Nagar we abandoned the Rishikesh-Chamba-Tehri Road for a Dehradun bypass road that seemed to have been laid down quite recently. We reached home by 8 at night, thanks to dad's experience in driving on hilly roads.
